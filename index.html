                My name is Elizabeth Garcia-Quilinquin. I'm orginally from a small
                island in Hawaii and decided to move out to the Continent for better
                opportunities. I have my Bachelors Degree in Science for Astronomy,
                but my work background is very extensive. I love to learn new things
                which I've done with my whole working career. I've worked in retail,
                hospitality, astronomy outreach/planetarium, customer service, food
                industry, and now I want to try my hands on coding and computer
                programing. I've worked with it in college for classes and worked with
                some of it for and electronics elective in highschool. My work ethic
                will usually speak for itself and for an employer to determine it. I
                never try to explain how great of a worker I can be but I always try
                to prove myself and raise my expectation for myself in a work
                environment. I try to learn the basics as quickly as possible and will
                always have questions later. "There is always room for improvement."
            </p>

                Some things about me: I love food, hence I do love to cook. One reason
                that I got into the food industry is to try out different food and
                flavors of different places in the world, and learn about them from
                different cooks. I will always try most new things and usually I
                really love it. Some say I'm a picky eater but I just want to eat
                something different everyday. I love books!!! "Zero batteries
                required". I'm improving on my reading now because a TV series
                adaptation is catching up to where I am on with the books now. I
                mostly read fiction, romance, and trying to get into science fiction.
                I zen out to books, music, and app games, but when I want to challenge
                my mind, I solve puzzles: jiggzaw, sudoku, karuko, mostly number
                puzzles. I also like solving crossword puzzles, and it forces me to
                learn a little something from them when I don't know a solution.
